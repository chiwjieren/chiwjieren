I'm Chiw Jie Ren, an 18-year-old ICT student at APU with a passion for turning coffee into code. 

## ðŸŒŸ Fun Facts

- I code like a wizard with a wand (or at least I pretend to).
- I firmly believe that any problem can be solved with a combination of coffee and late-night coding...with chatgpt.

### ðŸ”¥ Project: Financial Summary Automation
- I developed an automated system that generates and emails daily and monthly financial summaries using Google Sheets and Google Docs. Because who has time for manual data entry?
